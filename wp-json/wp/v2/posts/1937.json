As it is technical <a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/services\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you should hire an expert if you do not have much knowledge in this regard. Below are the main steps that come under a technical SEO audit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><b>Specify domain<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your website has many versions, like one that starts with www (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.company.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.company.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and another without www (https:\/\/company.com). For Google, these are two different websites. So, it is necessary for the audience to have access to only one variation, and others should be under a master version. It is due to the fact that having accessibility to more than one website can cause indexing and duplicate content issues, thereby affecting your website negatively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b7<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><b>Indexing issues<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An index is a database for hundreds of web pages as Google search results come from here.
