And needless to say, the introduction of reels has made this social media platform even more popular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statistics reveal that 2.35 billion interact with Instagram reels every month. Now that\u2019s a huge number!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only this but reels are known to have the highest engagement rate of 3.72%. They also have the highest video view rate of 2.54%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into account all these statistics about Instagram reels, it\u2019s safe to say that they make for an ideal platform for marketing. Businesses have been leveraging them for quite some time now, and the results, as expectedly, have been overwhelming, to say the least.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram Reels for Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are new to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/services\/social-media-marketing\/\"><b>social media marketing<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and want to benefit from Instagram reels, you have landed at the right place. In this article, we have shared a complete guide on how to use this full-blown Tiktok-competitor to improve your brand\u2019s engagement rate. But before that, let\u2019s briefly introduce Instagram reels:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Instagram Reels?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram Reels are full-screen videos shown vertically on devices. They can be pre-shot or recorded in the app. For pre-shot videos, the maximum allowed duration is 15 minutes, while in-app videos can be recorded for up to 90 seconds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users can choose from a host of editing tools, filters, interactive backgrounds, captions, and stickers to make their reels stand out. Furthermore, a vast audio library is available for them to use. They can also add multiple video clips.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are Instagram Stories and Reels the Same?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, they are different. Instagram Stories were actually inspired by Snapchat as they disappear after 24 hours. The same is not the case with reels, as they tend to stay available unless deleted by the user.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Instagram algorithm favours reels more as compared to regular posts and stories; therefore, making them a lucrative option for marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Use Instagram Reels for Business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep the following factors in consideration when making Instagram reels for your business in order to get better reach and engagement:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post Authentic Content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First thing first, you need to decide the tone of content, and this mainly depends on your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you have to make sure the content you post is authentic. Only then, it will be able to draw the attention of your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s given the purpose of posting the reel is to promote your brand, it shouldn\u2019t look like an ad. It can be off-putting for users. Ideally, you should find a perfect balance between coming across as a sponsored post or ad and a professionally crafted video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mainly, you should be able to relay your message to target potential buyers. The video (reel) should garner their interest and compel them to follow your account. Now, there are different ways you can do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you can highlight the user experience in reels. Similarly, focusing on commitment to sustainability and the environment in an engaging way can get you followers. Coupling the video with a captivating tagline or <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Call_to_action_(marketing)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>CTA (call-to-action)<\/b><\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0can help you create a winner reel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow the Latest Trends<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no better place than knowing about what\u2019s trending than social media channels. And for businesses, capitalising on these trends is a sure-shot way of getting noticed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you can use trending audio clips and signature tracks in your reels to gain more views and traction. Cleverly inserting your product\/service may benefit you a lot as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have gained a strong footing in the industry, you may plan to become a trendsetter instead of a trend-follower. This, however, is not exactly an easy feat to achieve.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market Promotions and Offers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram reels offer a great platform to market your exciting new offers and promotions. For example, if you own a retail store and are planning to launch a clearance sale, announcing it through reels can help you gain a lot of attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can highlight your products and the offer (% of discount, buy-one-get-one, etc.) through the reel in a creative way so that it could reach the maximum number of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlight New Products\/Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, if you plan to launch a new product or introduce a new service, you can leverage the power of reels to let your audience know about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, creativity is the key here. Since every other brand is doing the same, you need to stand out among the rest to be able to garner attention. And, of course, your post shouldn\u2019t look like an advertisement. You can use unique ideas to do so. Partnering with influencers is another great idea in this regard (more on this later).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Mix of Entertainment and Education<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly, reels are shared for entertainment purposes. People scroll their Instagram feeds for hours as they get entertained by these short videos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why the entertainment factor is a must in the reels you should create. However, you must overlook the fact that your primary purpose is to market your product or create brand awareness. This brings us to the main point here \u2013 creating a perfect mix between entertainment and education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, you should educate users about your brand or product while keeping them entertained. This is a strategy that will earn you brand recognition and followers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaborate with Influencers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since influencers already have people who \u2018follow\u2019 them and view their reels, collaborating with them can help you get recognition as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can particularly prove to be beneficial if you plan to launch a new product or there\u2019s an exciting offer on the card. The influencer will use your product or highlight the offer in the reel. They may also redirect users to your website or Instagram handle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrapping Up<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum it up, Instagram reels have great potential for businesses.
