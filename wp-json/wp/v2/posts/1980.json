A lot of SEO trends surfaced, made some noise, and now are making their way out to be replaced by newer trends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s the same story every year. What worked for your website, in terms of <\/span>SEO<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, may not work today. So, the right thing to do is to keep abreast with the latest changes in SEO trends and plan accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that said, experts at Zoom Digital have come up with top SEO trends in 2023, which will take centre stage in the world of search engine optimization. Take a look at them:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top SEO Trends in 2023 \u2013 Our Picks<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video Marketing to Become Part of SEO Campaigns<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2022 saw video marketing taking giant strides and emerging as one of the most preferred marketing methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube, even though it was already dominating the market since long, TikTok posed serious competition. Statistics reveal that 86% of brands have turned to video marketing to boost their leads. And it comes across as no surprise that more brands will join the bandwagon in 2023. So, terming it as one of the key trends in 2023 isn\u2019t wrong by any means.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some other interesting statistics about video marketing are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 50% of consumers use video when they have to buy something.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video marketing has proven to be effective in improving conversation rate by a significant 86%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video marketing video helps to improve brand awareness by 139%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube ads have convinced 7 out of 10 users to buy a product.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a video on your website, the chances of getting your website ranked on the 1st page increase by 53%.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These figures clearly demonstrate that consumers now prefer watching videos when they want to try new products or services. So, it makes complete sense to include video marketing in your SEO plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Focus on Online Shoppers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although online shopping was experiencing a boom even before 2020, it reached new heights of success when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since people were confined to the four walls of their homes, they relied on online means to shop for products or services they required. And this trend continues even now when the lockdown restrictions have eased all over the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking numbers into account, the revenue of the US retail eCommerce industry is expected to cross $1.7 trillion (per year) by 2027.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google trends in 2023 are also changing in light of this. In order to make it more appealing for companies to sell on its platform, the search engine giant has also increased the range of its services. Additionally, Google is ad-free. So, companies are not charged commissions for product listings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google, however, also wants to help online shoppers have a better shopping experience. The search engine firm has always prioritized the customer&#8217;s buying experience and developed a shopping graph for consumers. For this purpose, Google collects real-time data from product listings across several retailers. It accomplishes this using a variety of resources, such as product evaluations, videos, specs, costs, and advantages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if a customer doesn&#8217;t know the product&#8217;s name or brand, they can upload a photograph of the item to Google, and the search engine will locate it for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this clearly implies that you need to focus more on online shoppers when drafting your SEO strategies for 2023. Following these pointers will help you in targeting online shoppers in a better way:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your eCommerce website has a fast loading time.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be optimised for mobile devices<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your products listings must be optimised with relevant keywords<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The images must have Alt Tags optimised with keywords so that Google can find them<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Use of AI-Generated Content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many AI tools, in the past, have surfaced that produce content. However, the content produced by these tools hasn\u2019t exactly been up to the mark. In most cases, it\u2019s a far cry from being quality content that your website needs to be ranked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that E.A.T. (expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness) still matters. Therefore, trusting AI tools to generate content may not be a wise idea. Well, it wasn\u2019t until last year before <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ChatGPT\" rel=\"nofollow  noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>ChatGPT<\/b><\/a><\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came into the picture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content-generating tool, by far, has been the best in the business. However, can it replace humans in creating content? Of course, no! The tool, even though quite helpful, cannot replace professional writers. The content it produces looks like it\u2019s produced by a machine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having said that, it can prove to be of great value to writers as they can extract information in a quick time. SEO personnel can also take its help for various purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yes, when it comes to top SEO trends in 2023, the reliance on AI tools to generate content deserves mention.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimisation for Voice Search<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prompt and correct resolution of a user&#8217;s query is Google&#8217;s top priority. We all know that, right? So, as per SEO trends in 2023, more people will use voice search in 2023. And to facilitate them and assist its search engine to better interpret natural, conversational speech, Google has developed the LaMDA AI language system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This system can swiftly interpret a consumer&#8217;s inquiry about the kind of goods they&#8217;re seeking and provide the most pertinent answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the question arises, how to optimise for voice searches? We have got you covered in this regard as well. Here\u2019s what you to do in order to target voice queries:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Create posts answering your users\u2019 common queries<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When creating blog posts for your website, take into account the common questions your target users will have in mind, and then select your topics. Your blog posts should answer these questions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Optimise with conversation phrasing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s a difference between typing a query in the search bar and performing a voice query. The former can be precise and brief, while the latter can be a complete question. The idea is to optimise the website for voice queries since they automatically include text queries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Be concise<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Deliver concise, to-the-point answers so that users\u2019 queries are quickly answered. Make sure you have incorporated relevant keywords in your answers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rising Use of AI-Images<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like AI-generated content, AI-generated images are also about to take centre stage in 2023 as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certain tools that allow users to create AI-generated images. However, you need to be very tactful in providing them with details to be able to get quality images.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, these images cannot replace a professional image designer and editor. But, it can be of great help for SEO executives when they need a quick image before publishing a blog post on a third-party website to acquire backlinks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fewer Organic CTR<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the search engine giant developed several SERP features that directly respond to users&#8217; searches, we have noticed a significant decrease in Google&#8217;s click-through rate (CTR).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Google&#8217;s immediate replies, consumers may quickly find the information they need without leaving the search results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, Google works to retain people within its ecosystem because it has more control over what information is shown and how it is presented. In addition, the longer users stay on Google, the more adverts the search engine may sell, and the more likely they are to visit its affiliated services, such as YouTube, YouTube, Shopping, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it simply, Google&#8217;s SERP features have essentially taken over the entire screen, making it nearly difficult for other websites other than the product\u2019s official store to garner click-throughs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to estimates, the site that appears first in search results pages receives about 43% of clicks, followed by the sites that appear in positions two and three by 37% and 29%, respectively. However, this may not be the case, given the changes to the search result page dynamics. This is due to the fact that the majority of conventional organic pages rank quite low in the SERPs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Google wants people to spend more time on the verticals that are affiliated with it, we anticipate this trend to remain prevalent in 2023 as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Localisation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next on the list of SEO trends in 2023, we believe <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/services\/search-engine-optimization\/\"><b>local SEO<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is going to dominate the trends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google is definitely pushing for highly localised search results, so we anticipate that local companies will gain greater momentum from the search engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means it\u2019s time to concentrate on creating real, high-quality evaluations for Google My Business as well as other review sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you have it! These are some of the most anticipated SEO trends in 2023. Since the year has just begun, it\u2019s crucial that you get familiar with them at the earliest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For further assistance, you can reach out to experts at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/\"><b>Zoom Digital<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and get a robust digital marketing, SEO, or social media strategy to stay on top of your game in 2023.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]2022 saw a lot of changes in Google\u2019s algorithms for ranking websites.
