We can all recall household brands that stand for a set of attributes in our mind &#8211; automotive and consumer packaged goods have done solid work in this regard.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand identity starts with establishing the brand house and brand personality frameworks and continues on a roadmap for success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2: Be Crystal Clear About Your Purpose\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s customers are savvy, educated, and well-exposed to global, regional and local news and trends. They care about selecting brands that resonate with their own values and interests, and today they can with the abundance of brands, products and services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being clear about your business and brand purpose, positioning, and value that you add as well as delivering on those promises, will serve to establish not only clarity but, importantly, credibility with your customers. Credibility leads to brand love and, ultimately, differentiation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3: Create a Strong Visual Brand Identity<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong visual identity serves to distinguish your brand from competitors and allows for recognition and top-of-mind association for your customers and stakeholders. The logo, font and colors are the tripod to build any brand and stem out of the brand house, personality, values, positioning and value proposition. Creating a visual brand identity includes selecting appropriate brand colours, designs, and fonts in order to create all visual designs online and offline. The logo, in particular, is the face of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An impactful visual brand identity is one that stands true to your brand essence yet also is in tune with the time. On average, household brands re-brand or facelift every 7-10 years, while smaller brands and startups have more immediate needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Zoom Digital, we have years of experience in branding in multiple verticals and for various brand challenges.
