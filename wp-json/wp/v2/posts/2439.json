How can you persuade the public to walk into your store instead of the competitors?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s by shaping your USP (unique selling proposition) as it predicts the progress of your website. That\u2019s why considering the USP of your brand is pivotal, and if you don\u2019t have it, there\u2019s no predictability of the website traffic.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inconsistent Domain Name<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The credentials must complement your products and services when representing an online identity as a business. Among other tasks, we often need to remember to attend to them. So, it\u2019s one of the most common website design mistakes to avoid, especially in 2023 with growing competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should sound impressive and easy for the audience to remember.

As there&#8217;s a plethora of content present online, digital eyes need more patience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the first thing they notice in your profile is the cluttered homepage, ultimately losing them without converting to consumers. You must design the website so every age group can perceive the concept.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow Servers<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow serves are directly connected to the website\u2019s loading time, which negatively influences the brand. As per a report, an average viewer only waits a few seconds for a website to load before moving to another site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The size of the images, videos and widgets says a lot about how your service works.

You will ace it by making a delightful blend of relevant information and futuristic website design.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor Quality Visuals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve seen it before, but low-quality visuals are still part of the deal. Most business owners dismiss it as an insignificant factor. If visuals are important to your website, attention to clarity and precision is critical. Allow a professional graphic designer to handle the task, so you avoid repeating the same blunder.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No Search Bar\/Box<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search bars have become an essential component of any website. Most people, when they visit a website, look for a search bar to find things they need. If they cannot find it, they will eventually move to other options.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficult Navigation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If links are hard to find and buttons need to be visible, users will go through the website in circles and not straightforwardly. They won\u2019t take long before abandoning it if they aren\u2019t finding it easy to navigate. Resultantly, the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bounce_rate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>bounce rate<\/b><\/a> will increase, which means fewer leads will be generated.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Missing Call-to-actions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>How can you convert your website visitors into customers? This, undoubtedly, is one of the most commonly asked questions.The simple answer is having a CTA (call-to-action). Leaving out a &#8220;call-to-action&#8221; section on your website is akin to serving a fruit cake without cherries on top.Every website requires a high-tech CTA to persuade customers to complete their purchases. Keep it short and to the point, or it may irritate them enough to leave the site immediately.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Takeaway!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that a website doesn\u2019t go with the \u201cone and it\u2019s done\u201d creation. Since search engines are constantly updating their algorithms; therefore, you need to step up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the guide of most common website design mistakes to avoid, we suggest not setting yourself up for failure again.
