That\u2019s a common question that we often hear as digital marketers. While there\u2019s no denying that your website runs on content, you must\u2019ve heard about Google E-A-T (now E-E-A-T), have you?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the uninitiated, Google E-E-A-T convinces Google to rank your website by bringing Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. And that\u2019s what E-E-A-T stands for. In short, you need to make every ounce of the content count.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the concept has been on the radar since 2018, it\u2019s become one of the most pivotal SEO elements recently. Keep reading the guide below if you\u2019re wondering what it is and how the latest Google E-E-A-T update has modified the concept.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is E-A-T and How Does it Work?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-A-T is one of the major guidelines through which Google determines if the content is rank-worthy and valuable for the readers. As mentioned, it stands for expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Also, it\u2019s a 168-page doc utilized by human quality raters to rate the quality of Google\u2019s search results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is to ensure you\u2019re a trusted and reliable information source when they search for you online. With a prime focus on E-E-A-T, you can enhance your website\u2019s quality and achieve a higher ranking on search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving From E-A-T to E-E-A-T: Defining the New \u201cE\u201d in Google E-E-A-T Update\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it only had a handful of mentions in the earlier version, an entire section has been dedicated to it in the newer one. Previously, E-A-T stood for Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness before Google added an extra &#8220;E,&#8221; making it complete with \u201cExperience\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interesting part is that the Quality Rater Guidelines are regularly updated to sustain the latest changes in digitalization. Unsurprisingly, E-E-A-T is one concept that made its way to that document due to the Google E-E-A-T update.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent update keenly prioritises the following aspects, so try to get a hold of them when doing SEO for your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website should serve a useful and notable purpose.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It must follow all four principles: Experience, Expertise, Authority, and trustworthiness.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quality of the content must be up to the mark.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A description of the content creator must be present.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website&#8217;s reputation and credibility must be sufficient to be eligible for ranking.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-E-A-T Checklist: How to Determine It?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we&#8217;ve moved past the basics, Let&#8217;s talk about how Google determines the E-E-A-T of a website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 1. Experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience is a pivotal factor in SEO as it shows that someone has been trying to skyrocket their website&#8217;s success. Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve built themselves as an authentic source of information for the readers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that the longer you work on something, the more valuable it becomes due to your command of the subject. Ultimately, it makes your website a more reliable and trustworthy platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when a mom of two explains the best ways to burp a newborn baby, the content becomes as credible as a suggestion by a paediatrician. And that\u2019s exactly what the latest Google E-E-A-T update wanted with the introduction of \u201cExperience\u201d to the tool.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 2. Expertise\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expertise refers to a creator&#8217;s academic skills and proficiency regarding the subject area. If a website creator appears highly self-assured in his decisions, they will likely be considered an industry expert. Ultimately, it gets them a higher position on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Search_engine_results_page\" rel=\"nofollow  noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>SERPs<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if you\u2019re developing updated content based on the latest modifications, Google can easily perceive your website as an upright platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 3. Authoritativeness\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Google focuses on seeing if your platform is valuable for the readers, content authoritativeness is important as it showcases your website as a respected entity by well-known public figures and influencers in the digital industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can look into your website&#8217;s internal and external links and how well you\u2019re doing among the competitors. These factors make a lot of difference in increasing your visibility in the SERPs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While preparing the checklist, see how often other websites want to connect to you by linking to your content. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to display your credibility to the users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 4. Trustworthiness\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doing <a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/services\/search-engine-optimization\/\"><b>SEO<\/b><\/a> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for your website, trustworthiness showcases how much your readers believe in \u201cYOU\u201d. Also, see if they find it authentic enough to implement the learnings in their lives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By looking at factors like user reviews, client testimonials, and proven statistics, Google can declare your platform a devoted and decisive site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When adding this to the checklist, stay focused on the customer reviews, as they are the prime witness of your authenticity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of E-E-A-T for the SEO of a Website\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-E-A-T guidelines notify real human reviewers of exactly the type of content considered exclusive. Per their suggestions, you become proficient in creating great content containing the following.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content that helps users get immediate and workable solutions for their problems.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content that professional authors and writers curate.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content that\u2019s been posted on an authoritative website.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content that comes from a trustworthy source of information in the market.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content that keeps you updated with the latest trends and Google E-E-A-T updates.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The End!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum it up, trust is the most important aspect of their E-E-A-T algorithm. But that doesn&#8217;t make you take other factors for granted, particularly &#8220;Experience,&#8221; which they&#8217;ve mainly added to the update. Reading such content is as comforting as it&#8217;s authentic. And that&#8217;s what the latest Google E-E-A-T<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">update is trying to work on. Overall, you must appear with content that stands out from the crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For better results, consider getting a professional digital marketing agency on board.
