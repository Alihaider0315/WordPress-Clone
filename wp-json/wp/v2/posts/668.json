This amounts to almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/23865\/13-mind-bending-social-media-marketing-statistics.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.2 billion active social media users<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on various platforms. Suffice it to say, more than half of the total internet usage is directed towards social media platforms. Although there is a large variety of platforms, all of them have active and even unique users signing up every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aforementioned facts clearly prove the importance of incorporating social media in your digital marketing strategy. While the audience you\u2019re looking to target might be engaging on a different platform, the fact remains that all sorts of audiences can be reached through social media marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending upon the niche of your business, there are platforms that can work in your favour should you apply the right tactics at the right time. This is something that will require thorough research, something for which you can consider hiring a <\/span><b>digital marketing agency. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to understand your business and the type of audience that are plausible customers for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only after you\u2019ve reached a point of understanding pertaining to your business needs and goals can you apply the 7 pillars of SMM to your online campaign. These pillars are important aspects of social media marketing and can work for all sorts of audiences, provided you have them narrowed down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at them:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7 Pillars of Social Media Marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><b>Audience Research<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve already established the significance of researching the ideal audience for your business. This is key in determining how well your strategy will go. To keep it simple, let\u2019s just say you won\u2019t be doing yourself a favour by reaching out to doctors and selling them fertiliser. Similarly, targeting the youth to sell cars might seem like a good idea, but your chances of getting sales are significantly lower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audiences can be categorised and classified according to their interests, behaviour, etc. It\u2019s critical to know your audience because you can\u2019t target all social platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need a specific set of platforms that have the highest number of people relevant to your business engaging on a regular basis. If you hire a<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media marketing<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agency, they\u2019ll also spend time searching for target audiences and use any data they can find to narrow down potential masses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Quora is known to be a hub that has over 300 million users, with 43% being females, 35% being Americans, 65% being degree holders, etc. As a webmaster or advertiser, you can understand that information such as this can be integral in ensuring your social media marketing<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is targeting the perfect audience.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Strategy and Planning<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategising and planning your marketing goals are the next steps to take once you\u2019ve found the right platform and more importantly, the right audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every platform has its own interface and trends with respect to what and how people view content. For example, YouTube only supports videos and thus, you can\u2019t hope to reach people through textual content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, Facebook might allow multiple forms of content but depending upon your target audience and goals, perhaps going with slideshows might be better. People have hired a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\"><b>digital marketing agency <\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that excels in social media strategies just for consultations. Suffice it to say, even a consultation with an expert can be decisive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can look towards your competitors in this regard to have a better idea about what works. There can be a variety of ways to make an impression on users and establish a credible identity. Stats show that video content is likely to generate more trust when embedded along with texts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can probably deduce, this also depends highly upon how well you\u2019ve researched your audience and competitors. Simply put, it is important that you have a robust social media marketing strategy if you desire to succeed in this domain.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Scheduling and Publishing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something that most people often overlook and underestimate. Scheduling and publishing were thought to be irrelevant details of social media marketing before people started to realise the significance of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, every social media user is going to log on at some point in time during any given day. However, there are going to be millions of people posting updates that are going to crowd the users\u2019 feeds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why you need to enhance your audience research and figure out times when your users are likely to log on. An effective social media marketing<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agency<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognises scheduling and publishing as tasks of a critical nature as they can either break or make your overall strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re only working with numbers, go with the analytical data that will give you the ideal time to schedule and publish your posts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re encouraged to have multiple posts in your pipeline, timing them perfectly to land in people\u2019s feeds at the moment of logging on can really improve your chances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Listening and Engagement<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is better than search engines and even your business websites for users. That is because people feel more comfortable engaging with others and even businesses through familiar platforms. Most of social media marketing<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">involves engaging with users online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s vital for any business to generate a credible, trustworthy and authoritative identity in the eyes of the public. Regardless of whichever industry or niche you\u2019re targeting, you need the public\u2019s endorsement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where some of the most notable examples of companies like Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Wendy\u2019s, etc. are important for consideration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some of these companies resorted to sponsoring influencers and have them promote the company\u2019s products, others have sought endorsements through gifts and donations. This has worked because people believe a lot of things they hear on social media.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent Venmo cash campaigns have worked wonders in terms of influencing people and getting conversions. All good campaigns have been followed by massive user engagement and while you can\u2019t satisfy everyone, you are required to do as much as you can and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the key to succeed here is hiring a reliable and reputable digital marketing agency that specialises in social media marketing. For instance, hiring <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/zoomdigital.ae\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom Digital<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can ensure that your audiences are engaged and kept updated on everything your business is up to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to engage with your peers and clients, especially if you\u2019re new to the business. Not only will you face criticism and bad reviews, but you\u2019ll also have to respond to customer complaints and update them on what\u2019s to come.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Use of Tools for Analytics and Reporting<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not knowing how well you\u2019re doing is how you jeopardise your chances of success. You can\u2019t judge how your strategy is faring by comments and a few engagements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rely on hard facts, stats and analytics to keep a track of what\u2019s happening. There are many tools provided by various platforms such as YouTube Studio, Facebook Ad Manager, Google Analytics, etc. You can even find tools like Hootsuite and more that aid in social media marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tools can provide you with detailed insights into how every post has performed. You can take a look at the reach, impressions, interaction and engagement, retention, design and schedule posts and a lot more. Social media marketing<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also revolves around analytical reports that comprise data collected through various campaigns, often improving with trial and error.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stats are crucial in helping an advertiser understand how they can improve upon their strategy. Whether it\u2019s the content that needs improving, the scheduling that needs revision or even narrowing down target audiences, your strategy can become significantly better by regular reporting on analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s understandable that the work this entails can be frustrating and stressful. This is why we recommend getting in touch with a digital marketing agency that specializes in social media marketing. After they\u2019ve crunched the numbers, they\u2019ll let you know the gist of the important stats that can help you look for creative solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Branding and Promotion<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve established all of the above, you\u2019ll already be in the process of branding your business. Considering how different platforms provide different campaign options, you can choose to reach out to the masses. While quick and immediate paid campaigns can promise instant outreach, you need a viable long-term plan. Unless you hire a digital marketing agency to help you with it all, you should get started long before executing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting your business will become significantly easier once you\u2019ve figured out what your audience likes and wants. By engaging with them on a regular basis, you can find groups, pages, communities, forums and much more to promote your business. Make sure to include relevant links and information that your peers will find interesting, helpful and engaging. Much of your social media marketing should be focused on engaging the user before encouraging a call to action.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t just want people to know that your business exists. You want them to know what it provides and how credible an authority can be considered for any given niche. Don\u2019t be afraid to cover news pertaining to your industry even if your business isn\u2019t directly involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Advertisement<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, paid advertisements to come into play after you\u2019ve made sure that your social media marketing is going adequately well. While you can do it on your own, it\u2019s strictly recommended that you resort to hiring a digital marketing agency<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or social media marketing professionals who can save your budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid advertisements are of many types depending upon the goal that you\u2019re trying to attain. Even a million-dollar budget can be spent in a few seconds unless the advertiser hasn\u2019t set proper goals and narrowed down audiences to target. Whereas, a thousand-dollar budget can help you reach out to clients and generate the maximum number of sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All platforms provide their own advertising tools and interfaces. You can find all of them offering some or other types of classification and categorisation options that allow you to narrow down audiences. For example, you can use Facebook to target CEOs or Co-Founders of any organisation regularly spending budget or showing interest in specific niches\/products at any time. Similarly, other platforms also offer targeting options that can greatly save your advertising budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media platforms are showing no signs of slowing down in terms of garnering more traffic and signing up even more unique and new users. As of 2021, the average person spends around 2 hours and 25 minutes on social networks. The numbers only prove more useful when considering the youth who\u2019s found using social media platforms for almost 3 hours every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find stats like these changing every day only to prove that it\u2019s high time to target social media for your business marketing campaign.
