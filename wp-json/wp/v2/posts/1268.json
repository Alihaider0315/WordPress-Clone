Explore, Follow &amp; Engage!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for your ideal customers on Instagram is not that hard. The most basic and important thing you should do is observe the accounts who are following businesses similar to yours \u2013 if they\u2019re following them, then high chances are that they\u2019re possibly going to be attracted to what your business has to offer too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you can start interacting by liking and commenting on their posts and even sending them direct messages. But keep this in mind: avoid spam!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take your best time to form a genuine connection with your people and keep posting the right content, and your efforts will ultimately pay off.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Post Quality Photos!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you should post on your business Instagram account depends entirely on your business niche and target audience. However, make sure to follow these guidelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use natural light. In case you\u2019re shooting outdoors, then the late afternoon is the best time when the lighting is best. If you\u2019re indoors, just make sure to open up a window and you\u2019ll be good to go!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use high-res cameras to click pictures. If you don\u2019t have access to one, make sure to use the back camera on your smartphone instead of the back camera to get higher-resolution photos. Finally, do editing for a truly professional touch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Sound Like Instagram!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no such requirement for writing a lengthy, boring and detailed bio stuffed with business jargon.

Tag with #Hashtags!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add hashtags according to the words your target market might be searching for. However, don\u2019t overdo it. If you are including 25+ hashtags each time you are posting a photo, you\u2019ll look desperate and come across as spammy, which will adversely affect your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what\u2019s the ideal count for hashtags?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to stay with only 3 to 5 hashtags per post. This way, you can include sufficient hashtags to drag engagement but not so many that your entire account looks bizarre.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Practice Cohesive Feed!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a cohesive feed.
